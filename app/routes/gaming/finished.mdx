## Pre-2020

- Another Code: R (Wii) (Maybe the worst game I’ve ever forced myself to finish.)
- Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China (PS4)
- Assassin’s Creed (PS3) (So much potential…)
- Assassin’s Creed 2 (PS3) (Delivered on all the potential of AC1.)
- Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood (PS3) (It’s the best of all the AC games.)
- Assassin’s Creed Revelations (PS3) (A disappointing follow-up to the stellar Brotherhood. The shoehorned-in tower defense mini-game is just too much.)
- Assassin’s Creed 3 (Xbox 360) (It’s just not as fun without the massive buildings to hop around on.)
- Assassin’s Creed 3: The Tyranny of King Washington - Episode One: The Infamy (Xbox 360) (An interesting take on an alternate American revolution.)
- Assassin’s Creed 3: The Tyranny of King Washington - Episode Three: The Redemption (Xbox 360) (They added the “bear” power this time around. It’s a hulk smash. It _does not_ compare to the awesomeness of flight that you receive in Episode Two.)
- Assassin’s Creed 3: The Tyranny of King Washington - Episode Two: The Betrayal (Xbox 360) (Definitely more exciting than Episode One. Being able to fly is certainly bad ass.)
- Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (PS3) (It's the least buggy AC game I've played. Also, no Cha-ko-tey.)
- Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag — Aveline (PS3) (I would've been way happier if AC4 was twenty hours of this.)
- Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag — Freedom Cry (PS3) (More AC4, but the weird freed slave count was odd.)
- Assassin's Creed Liberation HD (PS3) (The reviews weren't superb, but I loved Liberation. It felt more like an Ezio game than AC3 or AC4, and that's a _good thing_.)
- Assassin's Creed Rogue (Xbox 360)
- Assassin's Creed Unity (PS4)
- Assassin's Creed Unity: Dead Kings (PS4)
- Assassin's Creed Syndicate (PS4) (Better than Unity.)
- Assassin's Creed Syndicate: Jack the Ripper (PS4)
- Batman: Arkham Asylum (PS3) (The best Batman game I’ve ever played. Great atmosphere and the predator parts of the game make you feel like the Caped Crusader.)
- Batman: Arkham City (PS3) (Not as fresh as Arkham Asylum, but exciting!)
- Batman: Arkham Origins (PS3) (It plays just as nicely as Arkham City, but the story feels short and the villains aren't used very well.)
- Batman: Arkham Knight (PS4)
- Bioshock (PS3) (Not as fun as Infinite, but enjoyable nonetheless.)
- Bioshock Infinite (Xbox 360) (One of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had with a video game.)
- Bioshock Infinite: Burial at Sea (Xbox 360)
- Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons (Xbox 360)
- Burnout Paradise (PS3) (By far the best racing game I’ve ever played.)
- Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood (PS3) (Decent Western.)
- Chaos Rings (iPad) (Best iOS game I’ve played so far.)
- Chrono Trigger (DS) (First RPG I ever finished.)
- Dear Esther (PC) (Not really a game, per se, but it was beautiful and haunting.)
- Dragon Quest IX (DS)
- Enslaved: Odyssey to the West (Xbox 360) (I really enjoyed the characters more than the gameplay. The jumping parts were fun, but fighting wasn’t always so.)
- Eternal Darkness (Wii) (Second game to ever scare me.)
- Firewatch (Xbox One) (Beautiful scenery and superb voice acting. The ending deflates like a worn-out tire though.)
- Gears of War (Xbox 360) (A short romp with big guns and ugly aliens.)
- Gears of War 2 (Xbox 360) (Had a blast playing this co-op with @AgentRaz.)
- Gears of War 3 (Xbox 360) (Had a blast playing this co-op with @AgentRaz.)
- Ghost Trick (DS) (Fun and stylish puzzle game.)
- Gungrave (PS2) (Blandon Heat, yo.)
- Halo 2 (Xbox) (An eight year old game that’s not HD, but played on an HD TV. Looked surprisingly good!)
- Halo 2 Anniversary (Xbox One)
- Halo 3 (Xbox 360) (Super happy to see HD graphics after Halo 2. Like all FPSes, as soon as I hit a difficult spot, I get frustrated and want to quit.)
- Halo 3 (Xbox One)
- Halo 3: ODST (Xbox 360) (Enjoyed the detective story style of story-telling.)
- Halo 4 (Xbox 360) (Shockingly good-looking for a last-gen game.)
- Halo 5 (Xbox One)
- Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary (Xbox 360)
- Halo: Reach (Xbox 360) (Looks beautiful. The Covenant have much more detail to them and the terrible face models from ODST have been cleaned up.)
- Heavenly Sword (PS3) (Super pretty, great voice-acting, but the game isn’t really fun.)
- ICO (PS2) (So good I’ve played it four times.)
- Journey (PS3) (An amazingly beautiful experience that's short enough that you could play it over and over if you wanted to.)
- Just Cause 3 (Xbox One) (Really enjoyed the destruction sandbox. I wish the jets would've come up earlier in the game.)
- Klonoa (Wii)
- L.A. Noire (PS3) (It’s like Grand Theft Auto without a lot of the terrible stuff. I recommend waiting to play the game until you have all the DLC installed.)
- Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass (DS)
- Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Wii) (Ashamed to admit it, but it’s the only console Zelda game I’ve actually finished.)
- Little Big Planet (PS3)
- Mark of the Ninja (PC) (Really good stealth action platformer, but the story is lame until the last chapter, but then the ending isn't truly resolved.)
- Mass Effect (Xbox 360) (Story is much better than the second game. Don’t play as a soldier. All other classes are more fun.)
- Mass Effect 2 (PS3) (Infinitely less frustrating than the first game. Wish I had played the first game first.)
- Mass Effect 2 (Xbox 360) (Had to play it again on 360 so I could carry over my save. Playing as anything other than a soldier is more fun.)
- Mass Effect 3 (Xbox 360) (Fantastic Acts 1 & 2, but oh the fucking ending. First S Rank! The Extended Cut DLC fixed most of my problems with the endings! The Leviathan and Omega DLCs are nice, but the Citadel DLC is a must-experience for any Mass Effect fan.)
- Mass Effect 3: The Citadel (Xbox 360) (The best way they could’ve sent off the crew of the Normandy.)
- Metal Gear Solid (PS1)
- Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (PS2)
- Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (PS2)
- Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (PS3)
- Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes (PS4)
- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (PS4)
- Mirror’s Edge (PS3)
- New Super Mario Bros. (DS)
- New Super Mario Bros. (Wii) (The multiplayer was more frustrating than fun.)
- No More Heroes (Wii) (A Japanese game with great English voice acting.)
- Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (iPhone)
- Portal (PC)
- Portal 2 (PS3) (Most fun I’ve ever had playing co-op and the commentary during the single-player campaign is a riot.)
- Red Dead Redemption (PS3) (My new favorite series/franchise. Captures all the best parts of Westerns.)
- Rise of the Tomb Raider (Xbox One)
- Shadow Complex (Xbox 360) (A fantastic Metroidvania game.)
- Shadows of the Colossus (PS2)
- Shenmue (DC)
- Shenmue II (DC) (I poop-socked the UK version in 4 straight days.)
- South Park: The Stick of Truth (Xbox 360)(Really funny, but the mini-games were often frustrating.)
- Splinter Cell: Blacklist (Xbox 360)
- Splinter Cell: Conviction (Xbox 360) (A quick, fast-paced spy movie that you can play.)
- Super Mario Galaxy (Wii)
- Super Mario Galaxy 2 (Wii)
- Super Paper Mario (Wii)
- Superhot (Xbox One) (One of the most innovative shooters I've played in years.)
- Tales from the Borderlands (Xbox One)
- Teslagrad (PC) (Whodathunk I'd be playing _and enjoying_ a steam punk puzzle platformer?)
- The Last of Us: Remastered (PS4)
- The Stanley Parable (PC) (Very funny, and lots to discover on your own.)
- The Swapper (PC) (Has a cool story, great Sci-Fi atmosphere and a neat gameplay mechanic.)
- The Walking Dead Seasons 1 & 2 (Xbox One) (Replaying on Xbox One.)
- The Walking Dead: 400 Days (Xbox 360) (_The Walking Dead_ is a lot less compelling when you haven't built up a relationship with the characters.)
- The Walking Dead: Season 1 (Xbox 360) (I appreciate its attempt to make a serialized TV-show-style experience and I love that my choices feel like they made a difference.)
- The Walking Dead: Season Two (PC) (The finale made you feel like your choices actually meant something. Here's looking at you, Mass Effect 3.)
- The Wolf Among Us (PC) (My new favorite adventure series.)
- Titanfall (Xbox One) (Most fun I've had playing a game online since Mass Effect 3.)
- Titanfall 2 (Xbox One) (Great campaign and superb multiplayer.)
- Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition (PS4) (Really pretty and surprisingly fun!)
- Trauma (PC) (At first a strange photo hunt, but after understanding the way Trauma’s secrets unfold, it’s a rather beautiful and striking game.)
- Uncharted 2 (PS3)
- Valiant Hearts: The Great War (Xbox One) (A beautiful game about a somewhat forgotten war.)
- Way of the Samurai (PS2) (Only game I’ve played through 10 times!)
- Wolfenstein: The New Order (Xbox One) (Had a great time with this game.)
- 押忍！戦え！応援団！(DS)
- 押忍！戦え！応援団！2 (DS)
- 龍が如く 2 (PS2)
- 龍が如く(PS2)
- 龍が如く 3 (PS3)
- 龍が如く 4 (PS3)
