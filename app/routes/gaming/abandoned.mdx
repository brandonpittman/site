- Deus Ex: Human Revolution (Xbox 360)
- Doom (Xbox One)
- Doom (Xbox One)
- Dragon Age (PS3)(So much Hanar voice effect. I can see and hear a lot of Mass Effect in Dragon Age.)

- Dragon Quest VII (PS1)

- Okami (PS2) (Stopped playing and forgot where to go next. I kind of want to try it out when the PS3 re-release comes out.)

- Rogue Legacy (PC)
- Shadow of the Colossus (PS3)
- Skyrim: Special Edition (Xbox One)

- Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (Mac) (I love Mass Effect, I like Dragon Age, and I like Star Wars. I don’t know why I keep starting and not finishing this game.)
- Super Mario 3D Land (3DS)(It’s Mario, and it’s good, but it’s not exciting anymore.)
- Super Meat Boy (Xbox 360)(This is a brutal game. I wanted to keep playing it, but the difficulty was killing me.)

- The Witcher (PC)
- The Witness (Xbox One) (Got some real puzzlers there.)
- The World Ends With You (DS)
