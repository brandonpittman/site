# Colophon

This site is maintained by Brandon Pittman. You can [email any feedback or
questions](mailto:hey@blp.is). The source code for this site is [publicly
available on GitHub](https://github.com/brandonpittman/site).

## Frontend

### React

The site is built upon the web framework [Remix](https://remix.run).

### MDX

I use MDX on most pages to easily write up content, allowing me to mostly just
write text and mix in a React component or two if necessary.

### Tailwind CSS

All the styling is handled by Tailwind CSS. It's mostly vanilla Tailwind, along
with the typography plugin and supplemented by my [fancy plugin][].

Other styling related libraries used:

- Heroicons
- Headless UI

## Backend

- Cloudflare Pages (hosting)
- Upstash (Redis cache)

## Editor

- Neovim

[fancy plugin]: https://github.com/brandonpittman/tailwindcss-plugin-fancy
