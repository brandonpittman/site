# Colophon

This site is maintained by Brandon Pittman. You can [email any feedback or
questions](mailto:hey@blp.is). The source code for this site is [publicly
available on GitHub](https://github.com/brandonpittman/site).

## Frontend

### React

The site is built upon the web framework [Remix](https://remix.run).

### MDX

I use MDX on most pages to easily write up content, but I really want to replace the MDX pages with standard TSX.

### Tailwind CSS

All the styling is handled by Tailwind CSS. It's mostly vanilla Tailwind, along
with the typography plugin and supplemented by my [fancy plugin][]. I've moved away from Tailwind at work, and I'm ready to switch this site's styling over to [Vanilla Extract][ve].

Other styling related libraries used:

- Heroicons
- Headless UI

## Backend

- Cloudflare Pages (hosting)
- Upstash (Redis cache)

## Editor

- Neovim
