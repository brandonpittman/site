Hey there! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Brandon Pittman. I build web
sites and apps, study [traditional Stoicism][], and I train Brazilian
jiu-jitsu. I sometimes [write](/writing) about programming, Stoic ideals, and
managing time and attention. I don't use social media aside from [GitHub][] or
[Dribbble][]. My backstory is on the [About](/about) page.

If you'd like to help support my continued work on open source software, or
you'd like to say "thanks" for something of mine that you used or read that
gave you some benefit, then consider [buying me a
coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/blp).
