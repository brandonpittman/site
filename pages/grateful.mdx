# Support My Work

If you're interested in showing support for the projects I work on or
you'd just like to say "Thanks for being such a great guy", there are a
couple good ways to do so.If you'd like to get something for yourself
and support me at the same time, consider signing up for [Fathom Analytics][] with my affiliate link. If you don't need any analytics, I have a patronage page over at [Buy Me a Coffee][] You can make a one-time donation or sign up for a membership. Thank you for supporting me!
