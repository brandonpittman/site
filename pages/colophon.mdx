# Colophon

This site is maintained by Brandon Pittman. You can [email any feedback or questions](mailto:hey@blp.is). The source code for this site is [publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/brandonpittman/site).

## Frontend

### React

The site is built upon the React framework, Next.js. It's the best DX I've ever seen. Next.js lets you write React components that can be rendered server-side or client-side and you can create your own API routes and edge middleware.

### MDX

I'm using Nextra on most pages to easily write up content in MDX, allowing me
to mostly just write text and mix in a React component or two if necessary.

### Tailwind CSS

All the styling is handled by Tailwind CSS. It's mostly vanilla Tailwind, along with the typography plugin and supplemented by my [fancy plugin][].

Other styling related libraries used:

- Heroicons
- Headless UI

## Backend

- Vercel (hosting)
- Upstash (Redis cache)

## Editor

- Neovim
