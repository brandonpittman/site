# Design Better Inputs

## Text Color

- `#767676` is the minimum for contrast of gray on a white background
- `#EF0000` is a good error message color
- `#2DAB00` is a good success message color

## Sizing 
- helper text should be roughly 2 points smaller than the input font-size
- inputs with fixed character length should be sized to fit accordingly
- checkboxes should be about half the height of text inputs

## Layout
- max character length should be under bottom-right of text input
- group parent/child inputs visually (in a well or with a border)
- add read-only prefixes (like an `@`) to inputs that require them
- put error/success icons inside inputs (right-aligned)
