## Marcus is Here!

I'm having a great time watching my son, Marcus, growing rapidly. He's 8 weeks
old as of today. Lisa and I are doing well and so proud of our family.

## Still Stoic

I try to put the words of Stoics like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus
into practice on a daily basis. I am working towards being able to separate the
things I cannot control from the things I can. To not get angry over things
beyond my control. Strict towards myself, yet tolerant towards others. Momento
mori has had a profound effect on me. I keep the words, "you could leave life
right now" as the wallpaper on my iPhone to remind me throughout the day that
life is short and we must make the most of it. It also serves as a warning
against mindlessly picking up my phone. ðŸ™ƒ

## To the Things Themselves

After reading Oliver Burkeman's fantastic <amazon name="4000 weeks">4,000 Weeks</amazon>, I emailed him with praise and he recommended the book <amazon name="At the Existentialist Cafe">At the Existentialist Cafe</amazon>, which led me to studying phenomenology. The phenomenological attitude has been helpful in my efforts to design better software, revamp my personal productivity, and streamlining things around the house.

## _Arete!_

Most of my free time is spent studying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Latin, and Ancient
Greek. The jiu jitsu came up in an attempt to focus my mind and body on
something physical while the languages are connected to my desire to read
ancient philosophy in the original languages.
