description: Review of Cycle 1, where I completed most things, but didn't quite finish everything.

## Personal Projects

Shape Up: Personal Edition's first cycle is complete. The three main projects
for this cycle were:

1. Complete six chapters in _Lingua Latina_
2. Finish the kimura portion of John Danaher's _Enter the System_
3. Finish [Shift Nudge][]

Sadly, #1 wasn't completed. I only finished 4 chapters in _Lingua Latina_. The
demands of fatherhood as well as my continuing education in philosophy and
jiu-jitsu took up a lot of time and since I really wanted to finish up Shift
Nudge, a lot of time got pulled away from Latin. Four chapters isn't bad
though, but now that Shift Nudge is complete, I can focus on _Lingua Latina_ as
much as I'd like.

## Personal Productivity

I got a good grasp on how I want to handle personal productivity going forward.
I'm really enjoying using the new paper products I got from [Writepads][].
Their weekly planner is very minimal and well formatted. They also have a nice
little ledger memo pad that will be great for daily "closed" lists when my
Analog cards run out next year. (Yes, I've decided that I don't want to keep
using Analog).

## Journaling

I'm just about finished with _The Daily Stoic Journal_. It's been a good experience following along with the prompts this past year. For next year, I'm going to be using the Cortex Theme System Journal. I'll continue using _The Daily Stoic Journal's_ prompts, but at half the length for morning and night. Then in the Theme System Journl's large block, I'll reflect on my day following Seneca's nightly questions laid out in _On Anger_.

1. What ills did I heal today?
2. What vices did I resist?
3. In what aspect am I better?

The only thing I'm not sure about is what to do with the one-line block at the bottom of each page in the journal. I'm leaning towards writing down the next day's highlight like _Make Time_ suggests. This is still up in the air right now, and I'm not worried about changing how I use this block mid-notebook.

## Family Life

Marcus is growing up faster than I imagined. He's starting to hold his head up,
showing signs of being able to roll over, and figuring out what his hands can
do. As much as I miss the tiny baby I brought home in September, I'm excited to
see how this older baby is going to develop.
