Don't get mad because someone doesn't hear you correctly. Take the time to
engage with them calmly. Speak slowly and audibly. Don't get upset with someone
because they don't know what something is or how to do something. You were in
that position many times yourself. Each man is a fellow traveler and deserves
your compassion. Treat others tolerantly, but be strict with yourself. Stick to
your principles, but don't expect others to live up to your standards. And
don't make them feel ashamed that they don't. We're all heading towards the
same destination. Make the journey easier.
