title: "ðŸ’¥ Cycle #2 Kickoff"

Cycle #2 is starting today (2022-01-03). Since I'm not finished with _Lingua Latina_ or John Danaher's BJJ instructionals, I'll be continuing with projects pertaining to both topics. I'll also be adding a programming project I've been thinking about for a while.

## Lingua Latina

In Cycle #1, I aimed to complete six _Lingua Latina_ chapters (one per week). This is doable but it's also easy to miss some days. I actually finished four chapters, which I was pleased with, so for this cycles I'm shooting for four chapters again. That means I will be working on chapters 20â€“23.

## Go Further Faster

When I started doing self-study for BJJ outside of my in-person classes, I went for material that was too advanced. I'm rectifying that by rolling back to more fundamental knowledge. I'm working my way through John Danaher's _Go Further Faster_ series. I completed the guard retention part during the last cooldown, so for this next cycle, I'm aiming to complete three more sections:

- pin escapes
- passing the guard
- open guard

## 5-Day Email Course

I really enjoyed Oliver Burkeman's 5-day email course that came with a pre-order of his book _4,000 Weeks_. I wanted to do the same sort of thing for my own productivity system that I created over the course of 2021 that combines Stoicism, Essentialism, and a little bit of phenomenology.
