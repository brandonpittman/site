Every choice you make is a trade-off.
Can't do everything.
You're always saying "No" to most things.
There's an infinite number of possible things you could be doing, of which you can only do one of at a time.
Be okay with that limitation and enjoy the shit out of whatever you choose.

Be present.
Don't allow your attention to be pulled at by one of the things you didn't choose.
Allowing that is the fastest route to resentment and unhappiness.
You're a temporal being with a finite lifespan. Embrace it. You have no other option.
