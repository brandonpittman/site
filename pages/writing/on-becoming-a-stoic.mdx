Like a lot of people, my introduction to Stoicism was through Ryan Holiday's books.
I got introduced to the Roman Stoicsâ€”Marcus Aurelius, Seneca the Younger, and Epictetus.
Along with casual references to the early Greeks Stoics.
Zeno, Chrysippus, and Cleanthes.

_The Daily Stoic_ was a daily reminder to reflect on Stoic principles.
_The Daily Stoic Journal_ was an easy introduction to journaling.
_The Daily Stoic Podcast_ was (and is) a source of interesting conversations about Stoic ideas.

The problem I ran into, and I see with others, is that if you fall into the Ryan Holiday ecosystem, you start to see Stoicism beginning and ending with Ryan Holiday.

Ryan Holiday's turned Stoicism into a profitable business.
I believe he believes in its principles.
I don't think he's a bad guy.
But he's monopolized the Stoic mindspace.
_The Daily Stoic_ has commoditized Stoicism.
It's got a bunch of stuff for sale: poppy books, posters, desk calendars, and enough medalliions to sink a trireme.

This web of merchandise encourages you to stay in _The Daily Stoic's_ bubble, whether it intends to trap you or not.
Read the source material.
Learn Greek and Latin.
Immerse yourself in ancient history.
Learn about the world that spawned Stoicism.
