description: Review of Cycle 2, where I completed some things, but didn't quite finish everything.

## Personal Projects

### Lingua Latina

I was hoping to have chapter 23 finished by today, but I just started it last night. Definitely could've had it completed. Will do better next cycle.

### Go Further Faster

Hoped to have the following three series finished this cycle:

- pin escapes
- passing the guard
- open guard

I completed pin escapes and open guard, but only got through 3/8 of guard passing. This should've been done. Haven't done self-study in nearly two weeks. Can definitely do 3 series in a cycle.

### 5-Day Email Course

Aside from testing out sending emails using an API, nothing got done. I'm starting to think that I don't actually value this project. Not sure if I want to commit to working on this anymore.

## Personal Productivity

Really enjoying my stripped-down productivity system. I'm still burning through the Ugmonk Analog cards (still wishing I never bought them). My _Open List_ is being simultaneously tracked on the Analog cards and in the sidebar of my Writepads weekly planner. With just 10–15 projects in the _Open List_, the Analog cards feel even more superfluous than before. I'm using the Analog _Today_ cards as a _Closed List_, but once the Analog cards are gone (or I can sell them off), I'll be using a Writepads ledger notepad for my daily _Closed List_.

## Journaling

I'm using the Cortex _Theme System Journal_ and **I hate it**. The theme idea sounded good for a week, but it's unnecessasry. The daily tracker in the back of the notebook isn't nice to use and the arbitrary boxes on each page are restrictive in all the wrong ways. I regret buying multiple journals. Would love to sell off the ones I have remaining.

## Family Life

Marcus is 5 months old now. He can roll over in both directions and is babbling up a storm. He's working on learning to crawl and he's just the cutest thing.

## Work

Will be switching jobs shortly. I'll be doing something to benefit mankind instead of just making someone money (which feels good). I'll also be able to work with React and ReScript (and lots of other functional languages/ideas). Should be an exiciting cycle!
