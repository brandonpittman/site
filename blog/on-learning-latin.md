## First things first

- Watch [ScorpioMatianus' first _Familia Romana_ video][video]

This video will show you the pages from the first chapter of _Familia Romana_
and let you hear what classical Latin should sound like. You should be able to
understand all of the Latin and you'll probably feel empowered.

## If you enjoy it, buy the following:

- [Lingua Latina per se Illustrata, Pars I: Familia Romana][textbook]
- [Colloquia Personarum][colloquia]

These two books are the most important. The textbook is the basis of everything
and _Colloquia Personarum_ gives you extra practice with recently learned
vocabulary and grammar as well as filling in the story of characters in the
main text.

## When you start struggling, buy the following:

- [Lingua Latina per se illustrata. Pars I: Familia Romana, Grammatica Latina][grammatica]
- [Glossarium: Pars I][glossarium]
- [Exercitia Latina I: Exercises for Familia Romana][exercitia]
- [Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata: Teachers' Materials & Answer Keys for Pars I & II][key]

These books aren't required but they enhance your learning experience. The
glossary is great for figuring out what more esoteric words mean. The grammar
book is a helpful reference to all the different forms you'll encounter. The
exercises are helpful for reinforcing what you learn and the teacher's
materials are the only way to check if you actually got the right answers. I
waited too long to buy these four books and I regretted not buying them sooner.

## If you hit chapter 20 and are still enjoying it, buy:

- [Fabulae Syrae][fabulae]

_Colloquia Personarum_ runs out after chapter 24, so if you want more practice
in that style, buy _Fabulae Syrae_.
