Notes from John Danaher’s “Go Further Faster” open guard series.

## Default Positions and Entry

- Enter open guard with cross collar grip on the side of opponent’s back leg. Pull the lapel to make them step forward and square up. Your legs enter inside position - sticky feet behind their knees with toes splayed out.
- Default open guard structure: cross collar cuff, one foot on bicep, other foot on hip.
- If opponent is on knees: pull cross collar or push same-side knee to open sumigayashi/hook sweep opportunities.

## Core Principles (Always Apply)

- Trap an arm (ideally across centerline)
- Put both opponent’s legs in jeopardy
- Exert push-pull force on opponent
- React to resistance by reversing direction

## Defensive to Offensive Transitions

- Use inner arm frames when in defensive cycles.
- Open guard sweeps often lead to double seated position. When you reach double seated, immediately switch from upper body control to lower body control. Target their high leg first, but post leg works if high leg unavailable.

## Hook Sweep Mechanics

- The tripod position matters more than the belt grip - opponent’s trapped arm forced across centerline to opposite hip is the key. Belt grip is best, but front of belt or lapel pull works if needed. Pull cross collar or cross cuff to reach belt position.

### When Hook Sweep Stalls

- Switch directions: move your head to other side of opponent’s head, switch feet so opposite foot goes inside their legs, block opposite wrist.
- Create space with reverse shrimp if their balance leg is problematic. Can also use power leg to invert body, get knee on mat, force it over.

- If leg is long enough: sweep their balance leg directly with your foot (sasai).

## Movement Principles

- Use hopping (kenken principle) to work into sweep positions.

- Reverse shrimp creates space between your head and opponent when needed.

## Opportunistic Attacks

- Failed closed guard to back take attempts create armbar opportunities based on opponent’s arm position.

- Look for: elbow across centerline, arms away from body, head lower than hips, or feet locked over shoulder.
