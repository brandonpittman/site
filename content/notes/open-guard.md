# Danaher Open Guard Principles

Notes from John Danaher's "Go Further Faster" open guard series.

## Default Positions and Entry

Enter open guard with cross collar grip on the side of opponent's back leg. Pull the lapel to make them step forward and square up. Your legs enter inside position - sticky feet behind their knees with toes splayed out.

Default open guard structure: cross collar cuff, one foot on bicep, other foot on hip.

If opponent is on knees: pull cross collar or push same-side knee to open hook sweep (sumi-gaeshi) opportunities.

## Core Principles (Always Apply)

- Trap an arm (ideally across centerline)
- Put both opponent's legs in jeopardy
- Exert push-pull force on opponent
- React to resistance by reversing direction

## Defensive to Offensive Transitions

Use inner arm frames when in defensive cycles.

Open guard sweeps often lead to double seated position. When you reach double seated, immediately switch from upper body control to lower body control. Target their high leg first, but post leg works if high leg unavailable.

### Escaping Stack Pressure from Closed Guard

When about to get stacked from closed guard: bail to double cuff grip → transition to lasso or spider guard.

## Hook Sweep Mechanics

The tripod position matters more than the belt grip - opponent's trapped arm forced across centerline to opposite hip is the key. Belt grip is best, but front of belt or lapel pull works if needed. Pull cross collar or cross cuff to reach belt position.

### Hook Sweep (Sumi-gaeshi) Variant with Arm Trap

Cross cuff grip, underhook to elbow, back or belt grip on other side. Sweep to trapped arm side. Powerful but requires opponent on two knees (less common position).

### Hook Sweep vs Standing Opponent

Use lasso guard for yoko-style hook sweep - hook lasso foot into opponent's opposite leg.

Good setup: lost closed guard → switch cuff grips → establish lasso during recovery → sweep.

### Hiza-guruma Variation

Underarm grip on gi or underhook at elbow. Pull opponent's hand past your head so it can't post. Push knee with foot for hook sweep effect.

### When Hook Sweep Stalls

Switch directions: move your head to other side of opponent's head, switch feet so opposite foot goes inside their legs, block opposite wrist.

Create space with reverse shrimp if their balance leg is problematic. Can also use power leg to invert body, get knee on mat, force it over.

If leg is long enough: sweep their balance leg directly with your foot (sasai).

## Spider Guard Systems

### Spider Sweep Over Head

Foot under opponent's butt, pull forward while elevating elbow with spider hook, press cuffs down, send over your head. (Note: be careful with neck during roll.)

### Scissor Sweep from Double Cuff Spider

Double cuff spider (opponent on two knees) enables scissor sweep.

### Spider Guard Entries to Submissions

Double cuff spider or spider with straight lapel grip = good entries to top lock for triangles.

## Movement Principles

Use hopping (kenken principle) to work into sweep positions.

Reverse shrimp creates space between your head and opponent when needed.

## Opportunistic Attacks

Failed closed guard to back take attempts create armbar opportunities based on opponent's arm position.

Look for: elbow across centerline, arms away from body, head lower than hips, or feet locked over shoulder.

## Opponent on One Knee

### Single Leg Reversal (Wrestler's Reversal)

Sit up, hook arm under his up-knee. Grip his lapel with the hand under knee. Other hand grips same side lapel (straight grip from your perspective). Swing feet backwards, stand up, force into single leg takedown.

### Ankle Picks

Lapel grip OR post on floor with one hand, then ankle pick. Won't work if he's on toes.

Alternative when on toes: touch shoelaces to shoelaces, lapel grip, pull toward you.

### Ashi-garami Entry

Touch shoelaces to his, double cuff grip. Lift with laces of your foot to enter ashi-garami. Transition two stages into X-guard to sweep or stabilize. Can stand them up for takedown with back step into o-uchi-gari.

### A-Frame Position (Semi-Sumi-gaeshi)

Looks like half guard with your half guard leg hooked pointing out away from both of you. Other leg tucks into his crotch (creates A-frame shape).

Can take overhook and grab his belt/back even without underhook (normally want underhook in half guard, but this position allows overhook). As long as he's not controlling your head and you can control his other arm, can go into sumi-gaeshi.

### Bottom Half Guard Recovery

If in half guard without head control but can't get underhook: switch to A-frame leg position, take overhook to belt/gi back, get hand on his arm and cover wrist, transition to sumi-gaeshi from failed bottom half guard.

## Standing Opponent

### Tomoe-nage from De La Riva

Start from de la riva position. Tricep and lapel grip. Pull him in with legs and arms. Elbows go up toward your own shoulders, flare elbows out. When his head is over yours: tuck elbows to inside, push with legs. Reverse shoulder roll to finish tomoe-nage.

### Transitioning to Wrestling

Don't be afraid to go from back to knees if opponent pulls away → wrestling reversals. Cross collar, cuff, bicep grip is great for pulling, so opponents will back away.

Come up to knees for ankle picks OR come up to feet for lapel drags (favorite for standing game).

## De La Riva Systems

De la riva is great form of outside control. Leads to good tomoe-nage. Easy to get hands to mat with hiza-guruma.

### Side Tomoe-nage from DLR

If standard tomoe-nage from DLR doesn't work: hook arm and body around the de la riva leg, do side tomoe-nage.

### Tripod Sweeps from DLR

Can hit couple different tripod sweeps from DLR.

### DLR to Ashi-garami

Grab DLR pant cuff, transition to ashi-garami. From ashi-garami: sweep backwards OR transition further to X-guard to get hands to mat or sweep backwards.
