## First things first

- Watch [ScorpioMatianus' first _Familia Romana_ video][video]

This video will show you the pages from the first chapter of _Familia Romana_
and let you hear what classical Latin should sound like. You should be able to
understand all of the Latin and you'll probably feel empowered.

## If you enjoy it, buy the following:

- [Lingua Latina per se Illustrata, Pars I: Familia Romana][textbook]
- [Colloquia Personarum][colloquia]
- [Exercitia Latina I: Exercises for Familia Romana][exercitia]
- [Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata: Teachers' Materials & Answer Keys for Pars I & II][key]
- [A Companion to Familia Romana][companion]

These books are the most important.
The textbook is the basis of everything and _Colloquia Personarum_ gives you extra practice with recently learned vocabulary and grammar as well as filling in the story of characters in the main text.
The exercises are helpful for reinforcing what you learn and the teacher's materials are the only way to check if you actually got the right answers.
I waited too long to buy these and I regretted not buying them sooner.
_Companion_ will provide you with more context, a glossary, and grammar listings (in Latin).

## If you hit chapter 20 and are still enjoying it, buy:

- [Fabulae Syrae][fabulae]

_Colloquia Personarum_ runs out after chapter 24, so if you want more practice
in that style, buy _Fabulae Syrae_.
