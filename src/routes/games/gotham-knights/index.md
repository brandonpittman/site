There are a lot of so-so reviews about this game, but it's still set in Gotham and it was 75% off. ðŸ˜Š
Started playing and it's better than the reviews would lead you to believe.

The game has some cringe moments.
The pride flag randomly hanging at The Belfry was odd.
Odder is the email exchange where everyone's SUPER EXCITED about an upcoming pride parade.
And the one that really made me laugh is whenâ€”I'm playing as Batgirlâ€”she talks to a guy in a wheelchair and he says that some people think he can't hear because he can't walk.
Batgirl puts her hands on her hips and says, "Some people need to educate themselves."
I cringed.

The game isn't bad but it wasn't great.
It was okay.
And maybe that's fine.
