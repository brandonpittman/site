This is the first game from the revived Telltale. It happened to come out while I was reading the books.

I hate to say this, because I love the show and the books, but this game isn't good. The episodes are formulaic and the choices feel meaningless.

The final episode just for the deluxe edition, _Archangel_, was awful. It was Avasarala in a panic room texting people with two simple puzzles. The graphics also looked like something from the previous console generation.
