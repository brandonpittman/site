The big problem I have with the _Arkham_ games is that they all take place in one night each.
There's no time for Batman to do the normal detective work that he does in the comics.
In a typical Batman story, Batman is presented with a mystery or some kind of dilemma, and he spends a few days—or longer—trying to figure out the mystery.
He often has to wait for criminals to do something multiple times for him to figure out their motive, pattern, and how to catch them.
We need a Batman game that takes place over days, weeks, or months.
We need a Batman game that gives its story time to breathe.
And by giving the story the scope to develop, it will allow the game to show the man under the cowl and see the interesting character bits that Batman's large cast of characters affords us.
