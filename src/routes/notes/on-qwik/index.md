Qwik feels like it's being held together with bubblegum and Scotch tape.
Every update is a harrowing experience where you never know what kind of regression will pop up.
And the usual response from the team when you raise an issue is "Care to submit a PR?"
We can't just revert the thing released yesterday that caused the regression, no.
We need to keep the broken thing, restore lost functionality, and then fix the broken commit.
The person who submitted the broken commit never has to fix anything.
