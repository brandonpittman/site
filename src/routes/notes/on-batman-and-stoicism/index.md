I was recently a guest on [The College of Stoic Philosophers Podcast][podcast].
Mark, the host, surprised me a little with a question about what I'd recommend to someone coming to Batman for the first time.
I kind of blanked and said _Batman 66_ for live action and _The Long Halloween_ for a comic.
I don't think either of those are bad, but as soon as we hung up, I realized I missed a huge chance to introduce people new to Batman to the versions of Batman I love and that don't get enough attention from people unfamiliar with the character.

So what do I wish I had shared?
For something to watch, I don't think there's anything better than [_Batman: The Animated Series_][btas-amazon].
It's a Batman who isn't silly, isn't overly dark, and has a pretty balanced social life.
It's a Batman who is balanced, looks to make the best possible choices in any given situation, and worked to benefit the _All_.
The Animated Series Batman is probably the most Stoic of all the film and TV Batmen.

For something to read, _Halloween_ is a great story that introduces the whole cast of characters in Batman's world.
But it's spread so wide that Batman and Bruce Wayne don't get deep coverage.
A book that does go deep on the neurosis that plagues Bruce and Batman is [_Ego_][ego-amazon].
It's a one-shot that has minimal action and most of the book is Bruce alone with Batman in the Batcave.
He's wrestling with the two sides of himself.
He asks philosophical questions of himself.
He debates himself on the merits of letting Joker die.
You see Bruce come to terms with Batman.
This gives the reader a better chance to see Bruce's sense of justice and possible Stoic nature.
