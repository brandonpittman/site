## Lists

Things basically get filed into one of two lists—Open and Closed—taken from Oliver Burkeman's book [4,000 Weeks][4000weeks].
Projects and single actions mingle in the same list.
If a thing is a _project_ it gets a folder to collect any materials associated with it.
The open list is just an index of things I _could_ work on.
The one exception to this rule is the Someday/Maybe List.
Things that will definitely not get touched in the next six weeks goes in Someday/Maybe.

### Closed List

![Closed List example](/images/closed-list.svg)

My Closed List is based off of [Burkeman's _3/3/3_ idea for relaxed todo lists][333].

- DATE
- FOCUS TASK
- Three maintenace tasks
- Three sticky tasks (to start with)
- Notes for tomorrow at the bottom of the page
