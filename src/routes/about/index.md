I'm a frontend engineer and I live Nagoya, Japan but I'm originally from
Cincinnati, Ohio. I first came to Japan in 2004 for study abroad and after
returning to the US for one year to finish my degrees in International
Relations and Asian Studies, I returned to Japan as an English teacher. After
working in private and public schools for a decade, I became a self-taught
programmer. I caught the programming bug while automating
OmniFocus. After seeing what could be done with code, I learned
Ruby and then Rails in hopes of turning my hobby into a career.

After struggling to find enjoyment with the backend, I realized how much I
enjoyed the frontend. While learning a bit of Laravel, I discovered
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and quickly fell in love. I left my job as a
teacher and began working in frontend development. Recently interested in
functional programming, I got into [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io) and
then [ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/). With my newfound
passion for functional programming, I found that React made more sense to me
than Vue did, beginning my love affair with React.

For a time, I was deeply passionate about Tailwind. I've written a [number of
Tailwind plugins](https://github.com/brandonpittman/tailwindcss-plugin-fancy)
and promoted the usage of atomic, functional, and utility-driven CSS whenever
and wherever possible. Recently, I've lost my fervor for Tailwind and have been
exploring [Vanilla Extract](http://vanilla-extract.style) for its type-safety.

In 2023, I fell in love with [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io) because of its focus on SSR and reducing how much JavaScript gets downloaded and when.
I continue to love functional programming but I've learn to be happy with using it pragmatically within the confines of TypeScript.
To fulfill my desire to learn a more academic version of functional programming, I play around with Haskell and other ML-like languages from time to time.

All my open-source work is up on [Github](https://github.com/brandonpittman).

I'm married to a lovely woman whom I met by total chance at Oktoberfest in
Nagoya one lovely day in 2014. She's gorgeous, smart, and most importantly,
funny. We keep each other laughing on a daily basis and I'm lucky to have her.
My son, Marcus, was born in September 2021. Our second child is due April 2024.

When I have time for myself, I study philosophy, train jiu-jitsu, play video
games, cook, drink natural wine, craft beer, and good
whisky.
