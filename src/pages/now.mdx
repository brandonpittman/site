# Now

<Lead date={meta.date} />

## Family

My son, Marcus, was born on September 9, 2021.

## Work

My main source of income is from working at a startup here in Japan as a frontend engineer.

## Philosophy

I try to put the words of Stoics like Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus
into practice on a daily basis. I am working towards being able to separate the
things I cannot control from the things I can. To not get angry over things
beyond my control. Strict towards myself, yet tolerant towards others. _Momento
mori_ has had a profound effect on me. I keep the words, "you could leave life
right now" as the wallpaper on my iPhone to remind me throughout the day that
life is short and we must make the most of it. It also serves as a warning
against mindlessly picking up my phone. ðŸ™ƒ

The only social networks I belong to are GitHub and Dribbble.

## Hobbies

Most of my free time is spent studying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Latin, and Ancient
Greek. The jiu jitsu came up in an attempt to focus my mind and body on
something physical while the languages are connected to my desire to read
ancient philosophy in the original languages.
