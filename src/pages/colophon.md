This site is maintained by Brandon Pittman. You can [email any feedback or
questions](mailto:hey@brandonpittman.com). The source code for this site is [publicly
available on GitHub](https://github.com/brandonpittman/site).

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build).
All the styling is written using [CUBE CSS][cube].
The one place with JavaScript is the email address copy button on the homepage.
That's an Astro island built with Preact.
The site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
I wrote all the code with Neovim.
