This site is maintained by Brandon Pittman. You can [email any feedback or
questions](mailto:hey@brandonpittman.com). The source code for this site is [publicly
available on GitHub](https://github.com/brandonpittman/site).

The site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build).
I use MDX on most pages to easily write up content, but I really want to replace the MDX pages with standard TSX.
All the styling is written using [CUBE CSS][cube].
The site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
I wrote all the code with Neovim
