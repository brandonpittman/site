    <p>
      Welcome to my little corner of the Internet! This site is an attempt to
      get back to where we used to be in the 90's&mdash;everyone having their
      own personal site that told the world who they are and what they're
      interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is Brandon Pittman. I build web sites and apps, study <a
        href={traditionStoicism}>traditional Stoicism</a
      >, and I train Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I sometimes <a href="/notes">write</a>
      about programming, Stoic ideals, and managing time and attention. I don't use
      social media aside from <a href={github}>GitHub</a> or <a href={dribbble}
        >Dribbble</a
      >. My backstory is on the <a href="/about">About</a> page. If you're interested
      in what I'm [reading](/books) or [playing](/games), those lists are available
      too.
    </p>

      If you'd like to help support my continued work on open source software,
      or you'd like to say "thanks" for something of mine that you used or read
      that gave you some benefit, then consider <a

        rel="noopener noreferrer">buying me a coffee</a
      >.
